# lnkmx Project Overview

## Product summary
lnkmx is a mini-site builder for experts, freelancers, and small businesses who need a single link that explains their offer and captures leads. The core promise is simple: a focused page with offer, pricing, and lead capture that can be published in minutes.

## Positioning
- Category: link-in-bio + mini-landing builder with lead capture.
- Differentiator: fast AI-assisted first draft, mini-CRM for leads, RU/EN/KK localization, and pricing in local currency.

## Target segments
- Experts and consultants: sell services, collect inquiries, book calls.
- Freelancers: showcase portfolio, capture briefs, respond quickly.
- Small service businesses: booking, pricing, and FAQs in one page.
- Creators: consolidate links, drive to offers, collect leads.

## Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
- When I share one link in bio, I want visitors to understand my offer and book or leave an inquiry without asking the same questions.
- When I need a landing quickly, I want a strong first draft without hiring a designer or developer.
- When leads arrive, I want a simple pipeline to track status and avoid missing follow ups.
